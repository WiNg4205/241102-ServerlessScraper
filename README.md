# 02/11/24 - Serverless Scraper
This is a page that displays a table of the top 100 most valuable public companies in the world. The data is loaded from a lambda function which scrapes from the website [text](https://companiesmarketcap.com).

My next major project will be to make a chess bot in python and nextjs for frontend so I need to first be familiar on how to write a lambda function and connect it to the frontend which is what I did with todays miniproject. I plan to learn the basics of AI by implementing various algorithms of naughts and crosses first and then gradually move up to more complex games and algorithms.
